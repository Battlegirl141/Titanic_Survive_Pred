Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset
, using data analysis and machine learning to predict passenger survival. It was created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate skills in data science, Python programming, and exploratory analysis.

📂 Project Overview

The notebook includes:

Data exploration & cleaning – handling missing values, feature engineering.

Visualization – uncovering patterns (e.g., survival by age, gender, and class).

Modeling – building machine learning models to predict survival.

Evaluation – comparing model performance and discussing results.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualizations)

Scikit-learn (machine learning models & evaluation)

✨ Key Takeaways

Gender and passenger class were strong predictors of survival.

Feature engineering (e.g., family size, title extraction) improved model performance.

Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved solid predictive accuracy.
